Title:

Bicameral Network for Provenance-Preserving, Differentiable Bitwise Information Tracking via Pigeonhole-Consistent Neural and Logical Graph Refinement

⸻

Abstract

We propose a general framework and network architecture for provenance-rich, fully auditable information processing and neural-symbolic learning, combining a bicameral (“two-chamber”) model of cognition. One chamber operates as a symbolic logical inference engine with bitwise provenance tracking, the other as a pattern-coordinating neural network, both structured as directed graphs with neural or logical edges.
A novel, differentiable pigeonhole allocation (“pigeon crusher”) algorithm enables the continuous, physically meaningful scattering of quantized or analog (float-valued) information through neural layers, preserving angular relationships and enabling gradient flow. All state transitions, bit operations, and quantile allocations are conserved and traceable, supporting applications in explainable AI, memory forensics, and efficient neural graph refinement.

Mathematical System Description

1. System Structure

Let
	•	G_L = (V_L, E_L, P_L): Logical chamber—nodes are logic states/bitstrings, edges are logical/bitwise operations (e.g., AND, OR, XOR, SHIFT), each with full provenance P_L (who/when/why/where/how/bit history).
	•	G_N = (V_N, E_N, P_N): Neural chamber—nodes are float-valued embedding vectors or neurons, edges are neural operations (weights, nonlinearity, transformation, e.g. f(x) = Wx + b), also with provenance P_N.
	•	Both chambers are potentially arbitrarily deep, wide, recurrent, and their edges can be static, learnable, or NN-controlled.

2. Provenance-Preserving Bitwise Logic
	•	Every transformation in G_L is recorded at the bit level: for every output bit y_i, there is a complete history h_i tracing back through all logical steps and packing schemas.
	•	The system supports packing schemas (arbitrary bit arrangements, strided/padded layouts, e.g. for quantiles, ints, floats, or tensors).
	•	Let \mathcal{B} be the space of possible bitstrings, and \mathcal{O}: \mathcal{B}^k \to \mathcal{B} be a set of general bitwise operations, each with traceable edge provenance.

3. Pigeon Crusher: Differentiable Pigeonhole Solution
	•	The pigeon crusher solves the generalized pigeonhole allocation for both discrete and continuous data:
For N items, M bins (with N > M), the system assigns/partitions “pigeons” (data components) into “holes” (bins/neurons) in a way that is:
	•	Fully differentiable (supporting neural network backpropagation)
	•	Physically interpretable (mappings are mass/energy conserving, angular similarity aware)
	•	Bitwise-traceable (all transitions can be tracked at the information-theoretic or packing level)
	•	The assignment can be formalized as a mapping A: \mathbb{R}^{N \times d} \to \mathbb{R}^{M \times d} where A is differentiable, and for every input “pigeon,” its fractional or probabilistic allocation into bins is tracked and recorded.

4. Quantile Conservation, Bit Packing, and Angular Similarity
	•	The system supports conservation laws for all information quantities (sum, norm, angular momentum if interpreted as geometric vectors, etc.), across every operation.
	•	Bitwise and quantile “packing schemas” are maintained—no bits are lost or orphaned; every operation is invertible or logged.
	•	For neural chamber, angular similarity (e.g., cosine similarity) is preserved as a constraint or regularization:
If vectors x, y are mapped through neural layers via f, then \cos \theta_{xy} \approx \cos \theta_{f(x)f(y)}, supporting explainable, interpretable transformation.

5. Fully Provenance-Rich, Traceable Graphs
	•	Every edge in G_L and G_N has a tuple:
	•	(data, operation, prior state, time, agent/owner, packing schema, quantile allocation, conservation law ID)
	•	These are written into persistent, queryable traces (for audit, forensic replay, or meta-learning).
	•	The bicameral mind operates by negotiating or reconciling states and transitions, with flagged no-consensus states, and explicit cross-chamber provenance for every operation.

⸻

Patent-Ready Prototype/Proof (Conceptual)
	•	Prototype: Two interacting graphs (logical and neural), each with an API for bitwise and float-wise transformations, provenance logging, and cross-graph negotiation.
	•	Algorithm: A differentiable, physically-inspired pigeon crusher implemented as a neural layer (e.g., soft binning with reparameterization), producing output embeddings and a full “bit log” of allocation.
	•	Demo: For any input, one can query any output back to its logical and neural ancestors, see packing and quantile allocation, and verify conservation (e.g., no bits or data lost, angular preservation, all paths explainable).
	•	NN-Ready: Edges can be implemented as neural networks (learned transforms, filters, routing logic).

⸻

Novelty and Utility
	•	Combines neural and logical reasoning in a single, provably auditable structure.
	•	Supports new types of memory forensics, explainable AI, and differentiable discrete allocation (for quantum, physics, ML, or cryptographic use).
	•	Uniquely able to trace, conserve, and explain all state changes, at bit and float resolution, across all logical and neural layers, for any packing schema or routing pattern.
	•	Enables the first differentiable, angular-preserving, pigeonhole-consistent allocation network for neural nets and logic graphs.
